Simon


 OUR VISION
Simon is an game of memory skill.  The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. . If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

Our Mission
Is to enable all learners' access to learning through the provision of:-

1. As a user, I am presented with a random series of button presses.

2. As a user, each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

3. As a user, I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

4. As a user, if I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

5. As a user, I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

6. As a user, if I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

7. As a user, I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

8. As a user, the tempo of the game speeds up incrementally on the 5th, 9th and 13th step.

9. As a user, I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
